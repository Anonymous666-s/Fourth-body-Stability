# Fourth-body-Stability
This is a computational astrophysics simulation dedicated to test the stability of solutions to the three-body problem under the influence of a fourth body entering the system.
## Three-body Problem
The code to the simulation of the original systems of the three-body problem can be found on this file.
## Fourth-body Addition
